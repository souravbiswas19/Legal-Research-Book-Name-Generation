# Alternative of OpenAI for Reasearch Book Name Generation and Facts Enhancements
These are the models that I have implemented for the task of generating research book name with a given query and enhancing facts legally.

1. Bloom
2. Google-Flan
3. Google-Gemini
4. GPT2
5. Intel-Flan
6. Mamba-BERT
7. Meta-Llama2
8. Microsoft-phi
9. Tiny-Llama

The implementation code are provided above. I have used Kaggle Notebook and Google Colab Notebook for implementing the task.

The demonstration link of each research book name generation and facts enhancement legally implementation is provided in the readme.md file in each folder.

Google Gemini and Meta-llama2 proved to the best models among all the different models involved in the research book generation and facts enhancement task.
The other models did not perform well as expected. Few models like Mamba-BERT, Bloom and Tiny Llama2 generared a decent legal research book names only.
